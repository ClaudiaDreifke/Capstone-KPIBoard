# EasyKPI
EasyKpi is a tool where a company can centralise all it's business processes' KPI (Key Performance Indicators) and their committed target values, independently of its origin software systems. 
The KPIs are assigned to a certain KPI-Owner, who is able to edit the KPIs for each month of a business year. 
The main feature is the KPI-Board which shows all the company's monthly KPIs in comparison with the committed target value. 
KPIs who meet the target are shown as green box, KPIs who miss the target are shown as red box, so one can 
receive an impression of all processes' performances at the first view.
